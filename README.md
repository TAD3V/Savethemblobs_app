# Savethemblobs_app


Easily save/manage SHSH blobs from Apple and Cydia


iOS Port of [Savethemblobs](https://www.github.com/iApeiron/savethemblobs)

Based on omz’s opensource [Python Framework](https://github.com/omz/PythonistaAppTemplate)

Thanks to [ccclauss](https://github.com/cclauss) for help with main.py

This is currently a working beta.

Here is a compiled [sideloadable IPA](http://www.mediafire.com/file/laio3ud311xxghc/Savethemblobs.ipa)

Blobs are saved by default to shsh inside the app’s own Documents folder, easily accessed through iTunes or iFunbox.


Anybody interested in improving this is welcome to contribute.
